## Upon analyzing Kickstarters campaigns, we find the following patterns:
*Campaigns launched in late spring/early summer were more likely to reach their goals

*Successful campaigns were those with more modest fundraising targets; in Kickstarter as in life, it is best to set realistic goals.

##Taking these factors into consideration leads us to believe that a playwright should launch a kickstarter with a goal somewhere between $1,500 and $5,000, and to maximize her chances of a successful campaign she should launch or May or June.
